               using spatial lag and eigenvector spatial filtering features},
  author    = {Liu, Xiaojian and Kounadi, Ourania and Zurita-Milla, Raul},
  abstract  = {Applications of machine-learning-based approaches in the
               geosciences have witnessed a substantial increase over the past
               few years. Here we present an approach that accounts for spatial
               autocorrelation by introducing spatial features to the models.
               In particular, we explore two types of spatial features, namely
               spatial lag and eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF). These
               features are used within the widely used random forest (RF)
               method, and their effect is illustrated on two public datasets
               of varying sizes (Meuse and California housing datasets). The
               least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is used
               to determine the best subset of spatial features, and nested
               cross-validation is used for hyper-parameter tuning and
               performance evaluation. We utilize Moran's I and local
               indicators of spatial association (LISA) to assess how spatial
               autocorrelation is captured at both global and local scales. Our
               results show that RF models combined with either spatial lag or
               ESF features yield lower errors (up to 33\% different) and
               reduce the global spatial autocorrelation of the residuals (up
               to 95\% decrease in Moran's I) compared to the RF model with no
               spatial features. The local autocorrelation patterns of the
               residuals are weakened as well. Compared to benchmark
               geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, the RF models
               with spatial features yielded more accurate models with similar
               levels of global and local autocorrelation in the prediction
               residuals. This study reveals the effectiveness of spatial
               features in capturing spatial autocorrelation and provides a
               generic machine-learning modelling workflow for spatial
               prediction.},
